# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for developers to **copy, paste, share** code.
A good _Cloud Engineer_ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.



Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`)
- Not to be confused with quotation (')

```
user_location = input("Where are you from? ")

if user_location.lower() == "new york":
  print("Welcome to the Big Apple!")
elif user_location.lower() == "chicago":
  print("The Windy City is a nice place to visit!")  
elif user_location.lower() == "los angeles":
  print("LA has great weather!")
elif user_location.lower() == "london":
  print("London is an amazing city with lots of history.")
else:
  print("I hope to visit "+ user_location + " someday!")
```
- When you can you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks

```python
user_location = input("Where are you from? ")

if user_location.lower() == "new york":
  print("Welcome to the Big Apple!")
elif user_location.lower() == "chicago":
  print("The Windy City is a nice place to visit!")  
elif user_location.lower() == "los angeles":
  print("LA has great weather!")
elif user_location.lower() == "london":
  print("London is an amazing city with lots of history.")
else:
  print("I hope to visit "+ user_location + " someday!")
```
